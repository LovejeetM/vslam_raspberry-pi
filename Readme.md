# Image/Video Depth Scan on Raspberry Pi

Hey, I'm starting this repository to explore image depth analysis using various models. The ultimate goal is to implement Visual SLAM on the robot I previously built. This space will serve as a sandbox for experimentationâ€”where I'll test out different depth estimation models and work on automating the robot's navigation in new environments.

### Here is the first image i rtested it on (this photo was taken on my phone):

### Added simple steup to get video stream from raspberry pi to the google colab
